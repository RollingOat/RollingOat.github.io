    Hi, I am a research assistant in Kumar Robotics Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interest lies in autonomy for intelligent robotics systems, focusing on 3D perception and navigation. This includes research topics on semantic mapping, scene understanding, and active perception. I am also doing research on multi-robot systems. Recently, I have been researching on visual language mapping and learned scene representation.
