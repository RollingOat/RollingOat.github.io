### LiDAR-only Autonomous flight for quadrotor

Developed LiDAR-only autonomous flight feature for quadrotor autonomy system, enhancing capabilities beyond
stereo cameras. Integrated lidar-inertial odometry for operation in diverse lighting conditions, conducted thorough
parameter tuning, and executed rigorous flight tests to ensure stable and reliable performance.

### Autonomy Stack for small-scale quadrotor 

- Developed the dynamic model of a quadrotor and implemented a PD controller and an A*-based path planning
algorithm in Python to successfully navigate the quadrotor and avoid obstacles in complex indoor environments.
- Implemented a min-snap trajectory optimization algorithm in Python to ensure smooth and rapid motion for
the robot.
- Built and tested a filter-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system that integrates information from an IMU and
a stereo camera, and demonstrated its performance in simulation
